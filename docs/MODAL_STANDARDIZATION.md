# Modal Standardization Summary

## Overview
All modals in the application now have a consistent look and feel with standardized headers and close buttons.

## Created Components

### 1. ModalHeader Component (`app/components/ModalHeader.tsx`)
A reusable header component for all modals featuring:
- Consistent title styling (2xl font-bold)
- Integrated close button (X icon in top-right)
- Support for custom project colors/themes
- Automatic color theming with background tint and border
- Optional close button visibility

## Updated Modals

### In `app/components/modals/` folder:
1. **NewCardModal.tsx** - Add new flashcard modal
   - Uses project colors for theming
   - Clear header with close button
   
2. **ViewCardModal.tsx** - View card details modal
   - Now has proper header with "Card Details" title
   - Close button added (previously missing)
   - Consistent padding structure

3. **DeleteCardModal.tsx** - Delete card confirmation
   - Red theme for destructive action
   - Clear header with warning styling

4. **CloseConfirmationModal.tsx** - Unsaved changes warning
   - Consistent header styling
   - Close button integrated

### Other Modal Components Updated:
5. **EditCardModal.tsx** - Edit existing card
6. **AddCardModal.tsx** - Add card (different from NewCardModal)
7. **DeleteProjectModal.tsx** - Delete entire project

## Benefits
- **Consistency**: All modals now follow the same visual pattern
- **Accessibility**: All modals have clear titles and close mechanisms
- **Maintainability**: Changes to modal headers only need to be made in one place
- **Theming**: Easy to apply project colors to modal headers
- **User Experience**: Users always know how to close modals and what action they're performing

## Key Features
- All modals now have explicit close buttons (X icon)
- Headers are visually separated from content with consistent padding
- Destructive actions (delete) use red theming
- Project-specific modals use project colors
- Responsive design maintained across all modal sizes
